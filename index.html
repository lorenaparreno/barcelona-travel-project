                    <h3>Bacelona, The City of Prodigies</h3>
                    <p>
                        The name ‘City of Prodigies’ was given to Barcelona by the Spanish author Eduardo Mendoza
                        Garriga in
                        his
                        novel of the same name, La Ciudad de los Prodigios. In this piece of historic fiction, Mendoza
                        describes
                        the period of time between the two Universal Exhibitions which took place in Barcelona around
                        the
                        turn
                        of the 20th century. According to him, this corresponds to the time when Barcelona truly
                        established
                        itself as one of the leading cultural and economic powerhouses in Spain and Europe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Around this time was also when the movement known as Catalan Modernism flourished in and around
                        Barcelona. The most famous of the architects to ascribe to the principles of Modernism was
                        undoubtedly
                        Antoni Gaudí – designer of not only the world famous Sagrada Família, but also Park Güell and
                        Casa
                        Batlló. However, others such as Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch were
                        also at the forefront of architectural innovation in Catalonia and Europe at that era.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, this was also a time of political upheaval and conflicting ideologies which
                        ultimately came to a head during the Spanish Civil War. Whether looking at its thriving
                        intellectual
                        and
                        artistic community, or the political revolutionaries who marked the beginning of the 20th
                        century in
                        Barcelona, it’s easy to see why this was a defining period in the city’s – and Spain’s –
                        history.
                        Mendoza’s novel served both as a homage to this great city and a reflection on the moment it
                        became the great European city it is today.

                        Hello! My name is Lorena and I have traveled to and lived in many cities around the world.
                        Barcelona is a vibrant city with whimsical architecture that makes it quite unique.
                        The city's history, art, culture, cuisine, beaches, and beauty has plenty to offer and
                        explore...
                        Currently, I live in New York City that never sleeps, learning about web
                        development and
                        how
                        to
                        code.
